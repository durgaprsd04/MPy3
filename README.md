MPy3
====
This is a repository that contains code for all our work done as our major
Project. The Project is based audio scene cut and have a great deal to offer in
such a domain. The aim of project is to develop a GUI Interface that has the
ability to help user choose an MP3 file with several audio classes in it. On
applying several algorithms on it, we could separate out several components.
The GUI is implemented using Tinker and the scientific compuation using SciPy
and NumPy. Our main motivation for doing this project is from the works of
Naoki Nitanda and others Hokaidoma University. Extending our courtsey to them.


##To Contributors.
As you are all are new to git, I will brief the set of instructions and thus it is easy for all of you to start working on the project. First you fork the reposity using fork button in the git home page. After than download the source to your PC using the following command. 
<code>
git clone reposity_name.
</code>

After cloning, you have this repository in your folder. Please edit it accordingly and after testing the code, you should do the following steps.
<code>
git add *
</code>
This will add all the sources that you have to add to your repository. Once you add all this you should commit using
<code>git commit  -a 
</code

This would open a editor window with a message for commit. This should be filled and all the files you commit at that moment will be having the same message as this. This should be clear and should notify what changes have you done to the project. After commit, you need to <code>push</code> the code to the main repository. This could be done using
<code>
git push -u origin master
</code>

After this if you had made a change that is necessary and is not in the main repository. That is the one I have you can send me a pull request and then I will add the change to the code accordingly. These are the sets of instructions you need to follow. For using <code>pull</code> you can type in
<code>
git pull
</code>  

inside the repository. If any doubts please go through the git manual available in the link . There are several concepts such as branching that could be used if a multi version development need to be done.


##List of source files
As you can see the of source files that are in the folder includes a MP3 cutter using a simple script. I will put in the rest of scripts ported to python.
