This is a repository that contains code for all our work done as our major
Project. The Project is based audio scene cut and have a great deal to offer in
such a domain. The aim of project is to develop a GUI Interface that has the
ability to help user choose an MP3 file with several audio classes in it. On
applying several algorithms on it, we could separate out several components.
The GUI is implemented using Tinker and the scientific compuation using SciPy
and NumPy. Our main motivation for doing this project is from the works of
Naoki Nitanda and others Hokaidoma University. Extending our courtsey to them.
